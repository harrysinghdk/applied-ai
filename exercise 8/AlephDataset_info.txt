-------------
In the Aleph experiment at CERN's LEP e+e- collider, Z0-boson (mass = 91 GeV) were produced, which subsequently decayed to both leptons (pairs of electrons, muons, taus or neutrinos) or pairs of quarks (u, d, s, c, and b) creating jets. 
This (simulated) data concerns only the quark decays, and the purpose is to identify jets from b-quarks (b-jets). These have a small but significant lifetime, allowing them to travel a bit before they decay, and they also produce a wider jet possibly with leptons of higher (relative) pt in them.

The input variables (X) are:
  energy: Measured energy of the jet in GeV.
          Should be 45 GeV, but fluctuates.
  cTheta: cos(theta), i.e. the polar angle of the jet with respect to the beam axis.
          The detector works best in the central region (|cTheta| small) and less well in the forward regions.
  phi:    The azimuth angle of the jet.
          As the detector is uniform in phi, this should not matter (much).
  prob_b: Probability of being a b-jet from the pointing of the tracks to the vertex.
  spheri: Sphericity of the event, i.e. how spherical it is.
  pt2rel: The transverse momentum squared of the tracks relative to the jet axis, i.e. width of the jet.
  multip: Multiplicity of the jet (in a relative measure).
  bqvjet: b-quark vertex of the jet, i.e. the probability of a detached vertex.
  ptlrel: Transverse momentum (in GeV) of possible lepton with respect to jet axis (about 0 if no leptons).

The target variable (Y) is:
  isb:    1 if it is from a b-quark and 0, if it is not.
